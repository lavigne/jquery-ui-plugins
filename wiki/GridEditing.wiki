= Editing Grid Data =
The grid comes with built-in text, numeric, integer, drop-down list and date editors. If one of the pre-defined types doesn't suit your needs, you can easily implement a custom editor. Editors are configured by specifying a column's [GridColumnConfiguration#editor editor] attribute as part of the column configuration. By default the grid's [GridAPI#autoEdit autoEdit] option is set to {{{true}}}, which means cells will be made editable when they receive focus, i.e. if they are clicked on or tabbed to. Setting the [GridAPI#autoEdit autoEdit] option to {{{false}}} means cells will only become editable when the are double clicked.
