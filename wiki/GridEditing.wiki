= Editing Grid Data =
The grid comes with built-in text, drop-down list and date editors. Text editors can be configured to only allow integer or numeric input by specifying the [GridColumnConfiguration#dataType dataType] attribute on the column configuration. You can also easily implement a custom editor if one of the pre-defined types doesn't suit your needs.
